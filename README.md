# Yelp-Analysis
A Python project for final coursework in a Northwestern University STAT_303-1 Data Science in Python course. The project was completed in 2022 as part of a four-person team.

The project involved conducting an examination of data from Yelp reviews across 11 metropolitan areas. Used correlations and associations between variables to deliver conclusions on user activity and how socioeconomic status impacts restaurant and business activity in urban areas.

Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, and others, were utilized to identify relevant associations and relationships that existed between variables to make conclusions.
